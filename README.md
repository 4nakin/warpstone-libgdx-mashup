Learning exercise for libgdx.  I liked the map generation in the Slick2D Warpstone example, and wanted to try the same technique with a libgdx 3D layout.
I borrowed code from warpstone for the map generation and the pathfinding technique.

Note about the eclipse project, you will need to patch up the classpath sources because they match up with development environment.
You will need to point them to your local libgdx projects.

About the controls, you can use WASD as well as mouse clicks and drags to pan around.  Use the 1 key to reset a view.
